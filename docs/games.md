title: Which games are supported?
---

There are a lot of supported games, all mentioned in the [handlers hub](https://hub.splitscreen.me/) and in the [list of supported games](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/opu0eg/list_of_nucleus_coop_supported_games/). A ton of games are now supported thanks to the amazing program called [Goldberg Emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator), developed by Mr. Goldberg, a big thank you to him. Read the [Goldberg FAQ](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/blob/master/README.md) if you want to know more.

*Do you not see the game you want to play in the list of supported games? Request it or check out [this guide](/docs/create-handlers) on how to create a handler for that game yourself. For more info on handlers, see [what are handlers?](/docs/handlers).*
