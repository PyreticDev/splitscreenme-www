title: What is SplitScreen.Me?
---
SplitScreen.Me is an organization that aims to reunite all split-screen open source projects under one banner, programs such as: Nucleus Co-op, ProtoInput and Universal Split Screen.


## General Information
Nucleus Co-op: Nucleus Co-op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it. Its purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally. The app was originally created by [Lucas Assis](https://github.com/lucasassislar). The developer [Zerofox](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866) later took over and added a ton of new features and improvements to support a lot more games. [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki) later joined in and brought multiple keyboards/mice support, extended hooks support and more great features to the table. Finally [Mikou27](https://github.com/Mikou27) added a new beautiful overhauled user interface with support for themes, game covers and screenshots, among other many quality of life improvements and scaling bug fixes.

[R-mach](https://github.com/r-mach) is the creator and developer of the SplitScreen.Me website that hosts all the available Nucleus Co-op game handlers.

The further development of the app wouldn't have been possible without the amazing contributions and hard work from all the Split-Screen Dreams Discord members (which include the devs mentioned above) that made all the new Nucleus Co-Op game handlers and continue to make new discoveries, tests and game handlers to support even more games, among them: [Talos91](https://www.reddit.com/user/blackman9/), [PoundlandBacon](https://www.reddit.com/user/PoundlandBacon), [dr. old.boi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Greppim), [Pizzo](https://www.reddit.com/user/AccoppaOrfani) and many more.

ProtoInput: Proto Input is the set of libraries used by Nucleus Co-Op to inject games with hooks for input (mainly multiple keyboards/mice) as well as window focus faking, etc. Proto Input is a massive improvement over the original hooks inside Nucleus and Universal Split Screen.

Universal Split Screen: Universal Split Screen is a standalone application that directs Windows input to enable local multiplayer in PC games with keyboards, mice and controllers. Universal Split Screen has been superseded by Proto Input, which is part of Nucleus Co-op now.
