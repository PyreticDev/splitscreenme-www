What is SplitScreen.Me?

Here's a short [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbituCgu3Bc) that explains an older version of splitscreen.me.

## General Information
Splitscreen.me is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it. The app was originally created by Lucas Assis, Zerofox later joined in and added a ton of new features and improvements to support a lot more games. Ilyaki later joined in and brought multiple keyboards/mice support and more great features to the table. The app is currently being developed and updated by these three [Lucas Assis](https://github.com/lucasassislar), [Zerofox](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866) and [Ilyaki](https://github.com/ilyaki). 
Also the further development of the app wouldn't have been possible without all the amazing contributions and hard work from the SplitScreen Dreams Discord members.

The website was originally created by [r-mach](https://github.com/r-mach), and is now open sourced as well.
