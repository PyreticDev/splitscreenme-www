* Download latest Nucleus Co-op from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop/releases):

* Extract the file with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/):

* Note: Goldberg Emulator, used by Nucleus, can sometimes be detected as a false positive by Windows Defender and some web browsers: see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/g2k8j7/is_there_any_viruses/fnmfhbp/) and [here](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/issues/118). You may have to allow it as an exception before extracting.

* Move the NucleusCoop folder to wherever you like, and run NucleusCoop.exe
  * You can place the folder wherever you like as long as you keep the following in mind:

    * DO NOT place it inside a folder containing files for a game you wish to play.

    * Avoid placing it inside a folder that has security settings applied to it, such as Program Files, Program Files (x86).

    * Some scripts require the Nucleus Co-Op folder to be located in the same drive as the game files.

    * If you are still unsure where to place the folder, the root of the drive your games are installed on is usually the best option. For example C:/NucleusCoop
