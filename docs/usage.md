## Nucleus Co-op

### Game setup

* Click the `Download Game Handler` button and search for a game handler for the game you want to split screen.

* Click the `More Info` button and be sure to read through the guide for the game.

* Click `Download`. When Nucleus asks to add the game, click Yes and browse to the game executable. Most Steam games will be in `C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\`

* Assign the input devices to parts of the screen by dragging the devices. The device icons will light up when they receive input. Change the layout of each screen by clicking the icon in the top-left corner of each screen.

* When you are ready, click the `>` button. If there are any handler UI options, configure them. Then press `PLAY`

* Wait a bit for the games to start and their windows to be positioned. If you are using multiple keyboards and mice, you may have to press the End key to lock input after the games are set up (see the game handler notes).

* Follow the game handler notes to connect the games together.
